# Masters-Project-BI5002
In this repository all the code to re-create the analysis presented in "Environmental and Habitat Determinants of Invasive European Rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) in Australia". 

The folder R Code contains the R scripts used to generate the pseudo-absence data, the script used to analyse the occurrence data, the script used to analyse the abundance data, a script for how all the figures and tables were created, a script of all the R packages used in the analyses and how they were cited and a script containg various bits of code that I needed to use to sort out issues with R.
